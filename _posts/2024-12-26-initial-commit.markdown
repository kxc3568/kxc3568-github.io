Hello to the void of the internet. In my first post I want to outline my vision and motivations for starting this site (i.e. my initial commitment to writing these some sets of blog posts, to explain my title joke).

To introduce myself a bit, my name is Kevin and I'm an Asian-American male born in the suburbs of TX. I grew up mainly in the familiarity of East/South Asian communities with many immigrant parents and high-achieving kids. And post-college, I moved to NYC to try and diversify my experiences and get out of my comfort zone. Currently, some of my main interests are - playing sports (roundnet, volleyball, pickleball), learning languages (espa√±ol and ÊôÆÈÄöËØù), trying new foods, computer science, and becoming a better person ('self-improvement' ü§¢).

It's hard to sum up anyone's identity in one short blurb and effectively filter what is informative and important, I feel, but this hopefully gives some context to my perspectives and posts. I will likely write another post on just who I am to even help me understand myself better.

Anyway, here are some of the main reasons I want to write blog posts, in rough order of importance:
1. To be more introspective, aware of myself, and have my thoughts organized
2. To practice other languages I'm learning
3. To research more ideas and build a deeper understanding of topics I'm interested in
4. To try something new
5. To better my writing (as I'm discovering now, ironically considering point 2)

I've always struggled with committing myself to schedules that are too rigid and inflexible and not being able to deliver. Because of that, I don't want to set any specific structure for myself but I hope to write here weekly or so.

That'll be it for now. I'll write here very soon again.
Kevin
